## 2025-08-06: Initial Product Analysis and Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Plemperer is positioned as a minimalistic personal expense tracker that prioritizes speed and simplicity over comprehensive financial management features. The product focuses exclusively on expense entry, categorization, and monthly organization.

### Context

Analysis of existing codebase revealed a well-structured SvelteKit 5 application with complete expense management functionality. The application demonstrates clear architectural decisions favoring simplicity, local data storage, and responsive design principles.

### Rationale

The minimalistic approach differentiates Plemperer from complex financial tools like Mint or YNAB by addressing the core need of users who want fast expense tracking without budgeting complexity. This focused scope enables superior user experience in the primary use case.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product positioning and user value proposition
- Simplified development and maintenance overhead
- Fast, responsive user experience focused on core workflows
- Complete data ownership and privacy control

**Negative:**
- Limited appeal to users seeking comprehensive financial management
- May require additional tools for advanced budgeting needs

## 2025-08-06: File-Based Storage Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use JSON files for data storage (expenses_YYYY_MM.json format) with planned migration to SQLite in Phase 1 of the roadmap.

### Context

Current implementation uses file-based storage with monthly JSON files and a categories.json file. This approach eliminates database setup complexity while providing adequate performance for single-user scenarios.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct SQLite Implementation**
   - Pros: Better performance, data integrity, query capabilities
   - Cons: Additional setup complexity, not necessary for current scale

2. **Cloud Database Integration**
   - Pros: Scalability, backup automation
   - Cons: Violates data privacy principles, adds subscription costs

### Rationale

File-based storage aligns with the product's simplicity principles and provides complete data ownership. The planned SQLite migration in Phase 1 provides a clear evolution path while maintaining the local storage philosophy.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero database configuration required
- Complete data portability and backup simplicity
- Perfect alignment with Docker deployment strategy
- Easy development and debugging

**Negative:**
- Limited query capabilities compared to SQL databases
- Potential performance constraints at high expense volumes
- Manual data migration effort required for SQLite transition

## 2025-08-06: Svelte 5 with Runes Syntax

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Svelte 5 with the new runes syntax ($state, $props, $effect) for all reactive state management throughout the application.

### Context

The codebase demonstrates consistent use of Svelte 5 runes, replacing the older reactive syntax. This provides improved performance and clearer state management patterns.

### Rationale

Svelte 5 runes offer better performance characteristics and more predictable reactivity compared to the previous syntax. The migration ensures the application follows modern Svelte best practices and positions it well for long-term maintenance.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved application performance and memory usage
- Clearer, more maintainable reactive state patterns
- Future-proof codebase aligned with Svelte evolution
- Better debugging and development experience

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for developers familiar with older Svelte syntax
- Breaking changes if reverting to Svelte 4 becomes necessary

## 2025-08-06: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Implement mobile-first responsive design with expense entry optimized for mobile devices while maintaining full desktop functionality.

### Context

Analysis shows the application implements responsive design with dedicated mobile month picker placement and touch-friendly controls. This reflects understanding that expense tracking often happens on-the-go.

### Rationale

Expense tracking is frequently done in real-time while making purchases, making mobile optimization critical for user adoption. The responsive approach ensures accessibility across all devices without compromising the core mobile experience.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Superior mobile user experience for primary use case
- Higher user engagement through convenient expense entry
- Broad device compatibility without separate mobile app development

**Negative:**
- Mobile-first constraints may limit some desktop UI possibilities
- Additional testing complexity across device types
